Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the software development process. In this repository, you'll find various examples of tests to help you understand how to properly test your code using modern testing frameworks. We cover everything from unit tests for small functions to integration tests that verify the interaction of different components, as well as full application tests using tools like Selenium or Cypress.
Testing Frameworks Used

    Jest: A popular testing framework for JavaScript and Node.js applications.
    Mocha & Chai: For unit and integration testing in JavaScript.
    Jasmine: A behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
    Cypress: End-to-end testing for web applications.
    Selenium: For automating web browser interactions and end-to-end testing.
    JUnit: For unit testing Java applications.
    pytest: For Python-based testing.

Types of Tests

This repository includes various types of tests:

    Unit Tests: Testing individual units of code in isolation.
    Integration Tests: Testing the interaction between multiple parts of the system.
    End-to-End Tests: Verifying the functionality of the entire application, usually from a user perspective.
    Mocking: Using mock data and services to simulate complex dependencies.
    Performance Testing: Evaluating how well the application performs under load.
